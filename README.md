# IPFunk
A Chrome Extension for forging common IP-Headers.

## Overview
The extension will send/overwrite common headers that contain IP information, tricking some pages into thinking you really have a different IP with each request.

The original Script was outdated and did not work anymore.

## Credits
IPFunk was initially developed by [Paul Da Silva](https://www.paulds.fr/2012/12/ipfuck-chrome/) as 'IPFuck'
